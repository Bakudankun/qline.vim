# qline.vim

The quick, easily-customizable status line plugin written in the cutting-edge
Vim9 script.

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4504807/96721994-db25e900-13e7-11eb-9628-0e774392227e.gif)


## Requirement

This plugin supports Vim version 9.0+. This means no supported Vim exists in
the world for now. The very latest Vim might make use of this plugin, but it
must be a temporary illusion.

This plugin is under development along with Vim9 script, so anything can
change. Not for daily use.


## Configuration

Every configurations are stored in a dictionary named `g:qline_config`. Its
format is like [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) but
with some differences. On loading qline.vim, the dictionary will be "merged"
with the default configuration, so you can check `g:qline_config` to see the
current configuration at any time.

The default value is written [here](autoload/qline/preset/default.vim).

## Colorschemes?

Currently the only default colorscheme is bundled. However, you can import
colorschemes from [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
and [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim).
To import, you need to install those plugins **and disable** them.

```vim
Plug 'Bakudankun/qline.vim'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
Plug 'itchyny/lightline.vim'

let g:loaded_airline = 1
let g:loaded_lightline = 1
```

Then you can use their colorschemes by adding `colorscheme` item to the config:

```vim
let g:qline_config.colorscheme = 'airline:cool'
```

or use `:QlineColorscheme` to change the colorscheme after startup.


## Troubleshooting

### qline.vim has been disabled for some reason.

When qline.vim runs into an error, qline.vim may be disabled forcibly by Vim.
`:call qline#Enable()` to re-enable.
